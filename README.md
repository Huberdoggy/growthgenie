### 🛠️ Dev Notes

This project is built in Replit using Python 3.11 and a secure `.env` pattern.  
`.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`, `config.toml`, and `.replit` are managed from the repo root.  
Directories containing static files - (i.e [`static/`](./static/) and [`images/`](./images/)) live at the root as well.
